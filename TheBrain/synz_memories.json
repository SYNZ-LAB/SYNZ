    "text": "User: [SYSTEM_EVENT: Log Watcher]: Based on the provided Unity log, the error is not explicitly stated. However, there are some potential issues that can be inferred from the log:\n\n1. **Non-Script Asset**: The log mentions \"non-scripts=3206\". This suggests that there are 3206 non-script assets in the project, which could be causing issues. Non-script assets include things like textures, audio files, and other resources.\n\n2. **Long Package Scan**: The log shows a long package scan time of \"1004.745ms\" for the \"InvokePackagesCallback\" step. This could indicate that there are issues with the package dependencies or that the package scan is taking too long.\n\n3. **Untracked**: The log shows a significant time spent on the \"Untracked\" step, which is \"1.959ms\". This could indicate that there are some untracked assets or files in the project that are causing issues.\n\nHowever, without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the error. Some potential solutions could include:\n\n* Checking the project for any corrupted or missing assets\n* Ensuring that all packages are up-to-date and properly configured\n* Running a clean-up of the project to remove any unnecessary files or assets\n* Checking the project's configuration and settings to ensure that everything is properly set up\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, you may want to try the following:\n\n* Check the Unity console for any error messages\n* Run the Unity editor with the `-batchmode` flag to see if the issue persists\n* Try to isolate the issue by creating a new project and importing the problematic assets one by one\n* Check the Unity documentation and forums for any known issues or solutions related to the error message.\nSYNZ: Unity Connected",
